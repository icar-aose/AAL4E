# AFERS - Autonomous Face and Emotion Recognition System

<p> This project wants to create a system usable on Structures for Elderly Care in order to track the assisted emotions in a span of time. </p>

<h4> The idea </h4>

<p> The idea is to use the script ot create some system for the recognition and the analysis of the emotions of elderly users, both in a private environment and in Structures for Elderly Care </p>

<h4> P.E.R. - Proactive Emotion Recognition </h4>

<p> After a person is recognised, their emotion is detected. If a neutral or a sad emotion is detected, the system will try to modify the elder's emotion using visual (and/or audio in the future) inputs to try to modify their emotions. If an happier emotion is detected, it is stored in a database </p>
